# eCalc
Perform calculations with numbers you see on screen, even on images.

----------
The program allows to easily grab numbers from anywhere on the screen. For example, you can find out how much all Chrome processes occupy in memory, see the screenshot attached.

See 'ecalc.7z' for compiled binary with all needed files.

The program uses Tesseract OCR software. For the program itself I used C++ with Qt framework. The project can be opened in QtCreator.
